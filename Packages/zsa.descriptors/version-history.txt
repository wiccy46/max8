1.1.0 (rev:21d0081cc25af1105875f057a5df5edad6f6dde9) : 5 December 2015
- added automatic support for standalone (you can not rename the zsa.descriptors folder anymore)
- improved Max 7 compatibility
- added Snippets for Max 7
- improved reference
- zsa.roughness: new external (#16)
- zsa.freqpeak~ automatic attribute (#22)
- zsa.mel~ automatic attribute (#29)
- zsa.bark~ automatic attribute (#28)
- zsa.ampstats~ always have 2 inlets (#27)
- zsa.dist: improved assistance
- MacOS 10.7 is now the minimum target
- zsa.dist: improved assistance


*******************
1.01 (rev:9b94982cdb38d12a88dba3bb95a65924ddf2fbd2): 24 February 2014
- zsa.descriptors folder can be renamed to whatever you like without breaking zsa.overview
- added package-info.json
- zsa.freqpeak~ can output up to 1024 pairs of frequency/amplitudes, and is lock free now


*******************
1.0 (rev:bc63dd02f83b3cbf02717dbf273c44b139976460): 24 March 2013
- zsa.fund: fixed memory corruption with very high pitches
- zsa.virtfund: new object which calculates virtual fundamental frequency
- zsa.virtfund: max_iterations, attribute to set the maximum number of iterations
- zsa.virtfund: outputs the calculation time (so it helps you to define the maximum number of iterations
- no more installer / uninstaller, Max 6.1 has packages support, and that's just great!
- updated documentation to be compatible with Max 6.1: reference and autocompletion.
- fully Max 6.1 compatible in both 32 bits and 64 bits, how cool is that?


*******************
1.0gm5 (rev:f63d3b798c1f030de3db3910c93276351227e01b): 11 August 2012
- works properly on 10.5 (10.4 is no longer supported)


*******************
1.0gm4 (r451): 23 May 2012
- zsa.flux~: new modes for positive, negative and euclidean flux
- Installation and Uninstallation commands for mac
- zsa.flatness~ works again in MSP64 (aka Max 6)


*******************
1.0gm3 (r444): 3 Jan 2012
- zsa.*: 64 bits versions compatible with Max 5 and Max 6
- zsa.mel~: no longer crash when changing dynamically the number of bands
- zsa.mel~ now lock free
- zsa.mfcc~: now lock free
- zsa.* fix for Modify Read Only support


*******************
1.0gm2 (r407): 5 July 2011

- zsa.dist no longer have dead locks
- zsa.ampstats~: now has only one inlet in a normal patcher, and 2 in the pfft~ context.
- zsa.dist: fixed assistance
- zsa.mel~: fix potential problem of clock freeing


*******************
1.0gm (r399): 12 April 2011 (internal)

- zsa.dist: new outputmode attribute to send out the key or the values out the leftmost outlet
- zsa.dist: read/write thread protection
- zsa.dist: fixed memory leak on clear
- zsa.mel~: fixed memory leak, and thread protection
- zsa.dist: improved thread safetiness
- zsa.dist: new output_distances attribute so you can disable the output of the normalized distance, for efficiency reasons
- zsa.dist: fixed kullback-leibler computation
- zsa.dist: useweights attribute and weights message to apply weights on the distance calculation


*******************
1.0rc1 (r354): 20 Mai 2010 (internal)

- zsa.dist uses another file format to have a consistent syntax no matter what the type of the key is so it's easier to generate/read...


*******************
1.0b7 (r326): 28 April 2010 (internal)

- zsa.dct: calculates Discrete Cosinus Transform
- reference documentation
- zsa.dist can read and write JSON files


*******************
1.0b6 (r270): 1 Feb 2010 (internal)

- fixed splash screen in the MfL context
- no longer crash when double clicking on the splash screen (introduced in 1.0b5)

*******************
1.0b5 (r261): 14 Jan 2010

- zsa.freqpeak: no longer outputs negative frequencies (or above Nyquist)
- zsa.dist now has an append attribute to automatically add a new key (for efficiency reason, doesn't verify that the key exists)
- zsa.dist quiet attribute suppress the automatic keys output for efficiency reason.
- zsa.mfcc~ calculates Mel-Frequency cepstrum coefficients
- improved zsa.mel~ calculation (uses amplification normalization)
- zsa.freqpeak~ is now thread safe
- zsa.mel~ is now thread safe
- splash screen which displays the version


*******************
1.0b4 (r226): 17 July 2009

*******************
1.0b3 (r202): 2 July 2009

- zsa.fund re-works properly (was broken during the windows port)
